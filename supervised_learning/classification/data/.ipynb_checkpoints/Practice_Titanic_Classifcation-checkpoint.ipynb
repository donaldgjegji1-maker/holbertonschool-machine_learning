    "In our previous analysis of the `Titanic` dataset, we played the role of a **Data Detective**. We looked at charts, calculated averages, and found patterns like `\"Women and children first.\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "But knowing *what* happened is different from predicting *what will* happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we are upgrading from **Detectives** to **Engineers**. We will build a machine that can look at a passenger's ticket and predict their fate.\n",

    "### The Goal: End-to-End Machine Learning\n",
    "This is your first complete Machine Learning project. We will follow the standard 4-step workflow used by data scientists at Google, Netflix, and Amazon:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Data Preparation:** Formatting the data so the computer can read it (Computers speak numbers, not English).\n",
    "2.  **The Split:** separating data into \"Study Material\" and \"Exam Material.\"\n",
    "3.  **The Model:** Training a **Decision Tree**; a model that learns by creating a flowchart of rules.\n",
    "4.  **Evaluation:** Grading our model to see if it's actually smart or just guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Phase 0. The Setup\n",
    "First, we need to load our tools. We will use `pandas` for data handling and `sklearn` (Scikit-Learn) for building the brain of our operation.\n"

    "## Summary of Our Investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have successfully built your first End-to-End Machine Learning model. Let's review what we achieved today:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Data Translation:** We took messy, human data (\"male\", \"female\", \"missing ages\") and translated it into a clean matrix of numbers that a computer can understand.\n",
    "2.  **The Split:** We protected our model from \"cheating\" by hiding 20% of the data for the final exam.\n",
    "3.  **The Logic:** We visualized exactly *how* the model makes decisions. We saw that **Sex**, **Class**, and **Age** were the deciding factors—confirming our \"Women and Children First\" hypothesis from the EDA phase.\n",
    "4.  **The Result:** We achieved an accuracy score (likely between 78-82%), meaning our simple set of rules can correctly predict the fate of 4 out of 5 passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"White Box\" vs. \"Black Box\"\n",
    "Today we used a **Decision Tree**, which is a \"White Box\" model. You can see every rule it made.\n",
    "In future lessons, we will use models like **Neural Networks**. They are \"Black Boxes\"; they might be more accurate, but they won't tell you *why* they made a decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Challenge: Can You Beat the Score?\n",
    "Don't stop here. Your goal is to push the accuracy higher (can you hit 85%?) without changing the model type. Try these three experiments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Select Better Features:**\n",
    "    We used `['pclass', 'sex', 'age', 'sibsp', 'parch', 'fare', 'embarked']`.\n",
    "    *   Does the model get confused by too much information? Try removing `fare` or `embarked`.\n",
    "    *   Does it need *more* info? Try finding a way to use the `deck` information (if you can fix the missing values).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Feature Engineering (Create New Data):**\n",
    "    Sometimes the raw data isn't enough. You can create your own columns!\n",
    "    *   **Family Size:** Create a new column called `family_size` by adding `sibsp` + `parch`. Does having a large family hurt your chances?\n",
    "    *   **Age Groups:** Instead of exact age (22, 35, 50), try grouping them into buckets: \"Child\" (0-12), \"Adult\" (13-60), \"Senior\" (60+).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Tune the \"Brain\" (Hyperparameters):**\n",
    "    We set `max_depth=3` to keep the tree simple.\n",
    "    *   What happens if you increase it to `max_depth=5` or `10`?\n",
    "    *   **Warning:** If you make the tree too deep, it might memorize the training data (100% score) but fail the exam (low test score). This is called **Overfitting**. Can you find the \"sweet spot\"?\n"
